## Introduction
Project made in Jupyter Notebook with [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which aims at detailed data analysis and prediction of which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic.

<b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\
1st = Upper\
2nd = Middle\
3rd = Lower

<b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

<b>sibsp</b>: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister\
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

<b>parch</b>: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\
Parent = mother, father\
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson\
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
